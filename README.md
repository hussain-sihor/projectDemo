## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Node.js (version 14.x or higher) and npm (version 6.x or higher) are installed. You can download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-nextjs-project.git
   cd your-nextjs-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Project

To run the project locally:

1. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

Here's a brief overview of the project's structure:

```
.
├── components    # Reusable components
├── pages         # Next.js pages
│   ├── api      # API routes
│   └── index.js # Home page
├── public        # Static files
├── styles        # CSS styles
├── .env.local    # Local environment variables
├── .gitignore    # Git ignore file
├── next.config.js # Next.js configuration
├── package.json  # Project dependencies and scripts
└── README.md     # This file
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm run dev`: Runs the app in the development mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.
- `npm start`: Starts the production build.
- `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint to catch syntax and style issues.

## Environment Variables

To configure environment variables, create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project:

```plaintext
# Example .env.local file
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com
```

Ensure you restart the development server after making changes to `.env.local`.

## Deployment

To deploy the application, follow these steps:

1. **Build the project:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Start the production server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Alternatively, you can deploy the application using platforms like Vercel, which is the recommended way to deploy Next.js projects.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
